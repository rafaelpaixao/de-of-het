# De of Het

Swipe to the right article (De or Het) for each Dutch word. At the end of the game, you can see how many words you got right.

The Dutch language is pretty interesting, however there are certain things in the language that have no rules (such as using articles de or het), which makes it difficult to learn. This game brings a different yet fun way of memorizing articles and pronunciation of each word.
